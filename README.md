Grab a video from the mp4 folder. Github has a limit of 2GB on filesize, which limits the length available.

Look at the youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQG-BaQ5cX9d5agXV6s7UPQ  for some longer segments, but I haven't found a way to make these available.

Grab the  file  from the json folder with the same file name.  (I should try to make the linking here automatic or give a spreadsheet)

Use goldencheetah software https://www.goldencheetah.org/  with the training mode.  Use the json file for both the workout and video sync settings, along with the video.


This may expand to more resources 
* to make this easier to do the download in one go.
* tools for me to join the avi files from my camera together - using OPenShot manually
*  docs on triming the gpx file gpsprune.
